**GroovyForth** is a minimal Forth interpreter implemented in Groovy. It serves as an educational and experimental platform for understanding Forth's unique execution model, stack-based architecture, and extensibility. The interpreter supports core Forth words, custom macro definitions, and eventually aims to serve as a lightweight virtual runtime for embedded or JVM-based applications.

## üöÄ Project Goals

- Build a minimalist yet extensible Forth interpreter in Groovy
- Emulate the behavior of traditional Forth systems (e.g., Jones Forth)
- Maintain runtime clarity by isolating execution logic in a dedicated context
- Enable experimentation with Forth-inspired bytecode and embedded VMs
- Facilitate scripting and REPL-based workflows on the JVM

## üõ†Ô∏è Architecture Overview

The system centers around a few key classes:

### `RuntimeContext`

This class encapsulates the state of the interpreter during execution:
- `Stack<Object> stack`: Operand stack
- `List<String> inputTokens`: Current execution stream
- `Map<String, WordEntry> dictionary`: Word definitions
- `Map<Integer, Integer> memory`: Simulated memory store
- `int here`: Memory pointer for allocation
- `int tokenIndex`: Instruction pointer for token stream

RuntimeContext supports isolation of execution state, allowing for recursive interpretation, macro expansion, and control flow management.

### `WordEntry`

Represents a word in the Forth dictionary.
- Fields:
  - `String name`
  - `Closure action`
  - `List<String> compiledTokens` (optional)
  - `boolean immediate`
  - `int address` (reserved for memory-based usage)

### `Interpreter`

The main control loop:
- Reads input as a stream of tokens
- Dispatches each token using `RuntimeContext.dictionary`
- Handles compilation (`:` ... `;`) and control flow words (`IF`, `ELSE`, `THEN`, `DO`, `LOOP`, etc.)
- Supports custom word definitions, literals, and basic arithmetic

## üì¶ Features Implemented

- [x] Stack manipulation: `DUP`, `DROP`, `SWAP`, `OVER`, `2DUP`, `2DROP`, etc.
- [x] Arithmetic: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `/MOD`, `1+`, `2-`, etc.
- [x] Comparison: `0=`, `0<`, `0>`
- [x] Memory: `HERE`, `ALLOT`, `!`, `@`
- [x] Control flow: `IF`, `ELSE`, `THEN`, `DO`, `LOOP`, `BEGIN`, `UNTIL`, etc.
- [x] Definition: `: name ... ;`, `IMMEDIATE`, `CREATE`
- [ ] REPL interface (planned)
- [ ] File-based script loading
- [ ] Bytecode generation (planned)
- [ ] JIT-style optimization (experimental)

## üìê Design Philosophy

- **Runtime Clarity**: All state changes happen via `RuntimeContext`, avoiding global side effects
- **Composable Words**: Each Forth word is a `Closure`, enabling easy composition and redefinition
- **Minimal Bootstrapping**: The system starts with just enough primitives to self-host new words
- **JVM-Centric**: Fully Groovy/Java compatible with no native dependencies

## üß™ Example Usage

```forth
: SQUARE DUP * ;
5 SQUARE .   \ prints 25

: FIB
    DUP 2 < IF DROP 1 EXIT THEN
    DUP 1- RECURSE
    SWAP 2- RECURSE
    + ;

10 FIB .
````
